👁️ Cataract Detection Using Deep Learning
This project is a deep learning-based solution to detect cataracts from eye images. It consists of two Jupyter notebooks — one for training the model and another for making predictions. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled eye images and is capable of classifying images into 3 classes mild/normal/severe.
